### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

Lab 7, part 1 was my favorite because it was my first encounter with functions. Functions have always been a very interesting and fun asset for me to use. This also inspired me to use functions to create a calculator program that I was able to make myself earlier in the year.

* Lab 10

Lab 10, part 2 was also my favorte because it involved counties and data from it which I actually like because I enjoy geography. And this lab had us use methods from file streams to extract data from counties. I use ways to get data from geographic areas at home for fun and this lab helped in doing so in a more organized matter.

* Lab 3

Lab 3, part 1 was also a very fun lab for me for a different reason than the ones I listed previously. The reason why was because it was finally the first lab I was able to create code and learn the methods to use code myself. To me it was more of breaking a learning barrier in code and I was able to satisfaction everytime I was able to figure out how a certain use was able to be navigated in the code.
